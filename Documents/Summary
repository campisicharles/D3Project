D3 Project: Veggie Tales

Summary: Our idea is to visually display the gain in popularity of meat substitutes in the past twenty years.  We will also show a list of the plant-based food companies and their gain in popularity over the 20-year observation period.  Our next step is to pick 50 meat food products compare them to meatless alternatives and display common nutritional factors of each. 

Data Plan: Pull API data from the USDA for nutritional content for meat and plant-based foods.  Do data cleaning and manipulation in Python. Merge data in a Mongo DB. Use D3, Plotly, Leaflet, Flask to create visualizations.
